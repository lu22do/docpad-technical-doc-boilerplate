# OpenTV 5 Application Developer’s Guide

## Overview

### Audience

This document is intended for developers using OpenTV5 to create HTML
applications. The reader is expected to be familiar with the JavaScript
programming language, HTML, CSS, and general object-oriented software
programming principles.

### <span data-spy="scroll">Custom vs. Standards</span> 

This documentation covers:

* Unique features of OpenTV5, and
* Deviations from standard HTML/JavaScript norms.

For general, non-specific information about HTML/JavaScript usage, refer
to one of many web resources, such as [*http://www.w3schools.com/*](http://www.w3schools.com/), for tutorials and specifications.

The *OpenTV 5 HTML Advanced Developer’s Guide* is also included in this
documentation set: refer to it for detailed advice about how to build
efficient applications using OpenTV WebKit, particularly techniques to
maximize performance on a hardware-limited embedded device such as a
set-top box.

OpenTV WebKit
-----

The main application development environment supported by OpenTV 5 is
OpenTV WebKit, a native WebKit­based browser and runtime environment.
OpenTV 5.1.4 has been updated to use OpenTV WebKit version 1.1.

The Ekioh browser previously provided for SVG-based development is now
deprecated, and described in [<span class="zlink">Appendix: Ekioh
Browser
\[Deprecated\]</span>](http://otv5docs/CCOM5.1.4/Support/Application%20Developer's%20Guide.htm#Racbabiecfj){.Link}.

### Supported Features

Standard features:

• HTML5
• CSS3
• Hardware-accelerated animations
• Video Playback using the standard `<video>` tag
• Web Inspector
• Cookies
• Same Origin Policy
• Web Worker
• Web Au
• Media Source Extensions (MSE)
• Encrypted Media Extensions (EME)

OpenTV 5-specific features:

• A JavaScript API (CCOM):  Allows applications to access the Middleware features of OpenTV5.
• Alerts: When using OpenTV WebKit, use <span class="Code">console.log</span>
instead of <span class="Code">alert</span> to output data to the console
log.
• Remote Controller keys
• Comprehensive debugging tools increasing debugging performance and
development efficiency.
• DSMCC (Digital storage media command and control)\
A protocol for simple data broadcasting and broadcast files systems.

### Running

To run an application on OpenTV WebKit:

• Prepare the html application package, edit the <span
class="Variable">*OTVAppMetadata.xml*</span> file, and set the <span
class="Code">&lt;APP\_TYPE&gt;</span> to "html" (<span
class="Code">&lt;APP\_TYPE&gt;html&lt;/APP\_TYPE&gt;</span>)

• Install and run the application using the Application Controller
(refer to the [<span class="zlink">Application
Installation</span>](http://otv5docs/CCOM5.1.4/Support/Application%20Developer's%20Guide.htm#Racbabdehbe){.Link}
section for details).

### Logging

OpenTV WebKit uses the OpenTV 5 <span class="Code">log</span> function
to save internal (and other types) of logs coming from various types of
JavaScript messages, including <span class="Code">alert</span>, <span
class="Code">console.log</span>, <span class="Code">confirm</span> and
<span class="Code">prompt</span>.

The OpenTV WebKit log format is:

STATUS : \[OtvWebKit\] \[XXXX\] code location : message

Where:

•<span class="Code"> STATUS : \[OtvWebKit\]\
</span>Is generated by the OTV log function automatically.

•<span class="Code"> XXXX\
</span>Is the log type, including "CONSOLE LOG", "ALERT", "CONFIRM" or
"PROMPT".

•<span class="Code"> code location\
</span>An optional JavaScript code location information, including the
file name and line number. This information is disabled by default, and
outputs only in verbose log mode. Refer to the <span
class="Title">*OpenTV 5 HTML Advanced Developer’s Guide*</span> for
details about how to modify the <span
class="Variable">*otvwebkit-config.xml*</span> file to enable the <span
class="Code">&lt;js-log-verbose&gt;</span> setting.

•<span class="Code"> message\
</span>A user-specified message in the JS API or Webkit message.

### Map a New Remote Control

To map a new remote control, follow this procedure:

1\. Edit lircd.conf, a file normally located at /etc/lirc/lircd.conf or
/etc/lircd.conf on the target file system.

2\. The lircd.conf file consists of pairs of string names and numerical
values.

3\. The lircd.conf string names are located in the “LIRC Key Name” column
of the key mapping table.

4\. HTML applications receive the numerical key values indicated by the
“OpenTV WebKit Key Codes” columns.

Commonly used remote control key codes:

**Key Name**

**OpenTV WebKit keydown keyCode (HEX)**

**OpenTV WebKit keydown keyCode (DEC)**

Refer to the [<span class="LiteralText">*HTML Key
Mappings*</span>](http://otv5docs/CCOM5.1.4/Support/Application%20Developer's%20Guide.htm#Racbabdcfdc){.Topic}
table in the appendix for less common keys.

**Key Mapping Example: Adding new Keys**

Some remote control keys have no clear equivalent, for those we
recommend using custom keys. For example, to add buttons for VOD and
PIP, add the following to <span class="Variable">*lircd.conf*</span>.

CUSTOM0 0xfc03ff00

CUSTOM1 0xbd42ff00

(Note the actual values may vary across remotes.)

In the JavaScript application, listen for "keydown" events, as in this
example:

// Add event listener to listen for key input

 

document.addEventListener("keydown", keyEvent, false);

function keyEvent(evt)

{

<span class="code2">if(evt.type == "keydown")</span>

{

<span class="code3">console.log("keydown keyCode = " +
evt.keyCode);</span>

if(evt.keyCode == 0xF500)

{

console.log("Received VOD key");

}

if(evt.keyCode == 0xF501)

{

console.log("Received PIP key");

}

}

}

### SSL Configuration

A sample certificate file, containing a useful set of certificates, is
provided with the OpenTV WebKit. It is located by default at <span
class="Variable">*/home/otv\_system/ssl/certs/CAfile.pem*</span>. This
file path is defined in the <span
class="Variable">*otvwebkit-config.xml*</span> using the <span
class="Code">&lt;ssl-ca-file&gt;</span> entry, and may be modified to
point to any location. If this entry is empty all https web sites are
accessible.

Refer to the <span class="Title">*OpenTV 5 HTML Advanced Developer’s
Guide*</span> for details about how to modify the <span
class="Variable">*otvwebkit-config.xml*</span> file.

Any new certificates must be added to the existing certificate file; all
certificates must be PEM encoded and concatenated into this single file.

The <span class="Code">openssl</span>[command line tool (refer
to](https://www.openssl.org/){.body1}<span
class="URL">*https://www.openssl.org/*</span> for details) may be used
to convert a certificate file, typically <span class="Code">.crt</span>,
into a <span class="Code">.pem</span> file.

The following command uses <span class="Code">openssl</span> to create a
<span class="Variable">*CAFile.pem*</span> from a <span
class="Variable">*net.crt*</span>:

openssl x509 –in net.crt –outform pem –out CAFile.pem

To create one .pem file from multiple certificates:

openssl x509 –in net1.crt –outform pem –out caf1.pem

openssl x509 –in net2.crt –outform pem –out caf2.pem

openssl x509 –in net3.crt –outform pem –out caf3.pem

cat caf\*.pem &gt; CAFile.pem

The <span class="Code">–outform</span> option ensures that the resulting
encoding is PEM, no matter what the input encoding or file extensions
may be. The final ‘cat’ command can be duplicated by any text editor as
the PEM encoding is stored as ASCII text. Note that the <span
class="Code">openssl</span> command itself assumes there is only one
certificate in a file.

HTML Media Elements
------

This section summarizes the supported HTML media tags.

**&lt;video&gt; Tag**

The <span class="Code">&lt;video&gt;</span> tag is a standard element
supported by HTML5 (refer to [<span
class="URL">*http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5\_video.asp*</span>](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp){.body1}
for full description). It is used to display and control video content
inside HTML applications.

Starting with OTV 5.1.2, the <span class="Code">&lt;video&gt;</span> tag
is able to display videos in the standard manner without using the CCOM
Player object.

Note that the previous video tag behavior, using CCOM Player, is still
supported.

• The <span class="Code">href/src</span> field of the <span
class="Code">&lt;video&gt;</span> tag is used to specify a real source
URL, for example: <span
class="Code">http://youtube.com/a\_video.mp4</span>.

The <span class="Code">xlink:href</span> attribute value should be set
to the empty string <span class="Code">xlink:href=""</span>.

The <span class="Code">xlink:href="display://0"</span> setting is
ignored.

• If the application uses a video tag along with the CCOM Player, it
must specify a video destination for the <span
class="Code">&lt;video&gt;</span> tag to be paired with the CCOM player
instance. This is done by using a custom <span
class="Code">&lt;param&gt;</span> attribute, called <span
class="Code">otv-video-destination</span>. For example:

&lt;video id="video0" x="0" y="0" width="1280" height="720"
xlink:href=""&gt;

<span class="CodeBold">**&lt;param name="otv-video-destination"
value="display://0" /&gt;**</span>

&lt;/video&gt;

In this example, the <span class="Code">&lt;video&gt;</span> tag
"video0" specifies the video destination "display://0", and it will be
paired with the CCOM player instance with <span
class="Code">destUri</span> "display://0".

• If application does not use the CCOM Player for video control, it can
specify a video destination for the <span
class="Code">&lt;video&gt;</span> tag to be paired with an existing CCOM
player instance whose <span class="Code">destUri</span> matches the
value field (“display://0”). This prevents the creation of a new player
instance which saves memory/decoder resources:

&lt;video id="video0" x="0" y="0" width="1280" height="720" <span
class="CodeBold">**xlink:href="http://youtube.com/myvideo.mp4"**</span>&gt;

&lt;param name="otv-video-destination" value="display://0" /&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

In this example, the <span class="Code">&lt;video&gt; </span>tag
"video0" also specifies the valid source url, which instructs the player
instance with <span class="Code">destUri</span> "display://0" to play
the source url "http://youtube.com/myvideo.mp4" automatically.

• For HTML, the custom "otv-video-destination" field can be set within
the <span class="Code">&lt;video&gt;</span> tag declaration to specify a
video destination. For example:

&lt;video id="v1" width=1280 height=720 <span
class="CodeBold">**src="http://a.mp4**</span>"
otv-video-destination="display://0" /&gt;

• When a video destination for the <span
class="Code">&lt;video-&gt;</span> tag is not specified, no CCOM player
instance will be paired with the <span class="Code">&lt;video&gt;</span>
tag. In this case, the browser creates a unique player instance, and the
application can only use the standard W3C <span
class="Code">&lt;video&gt;</span> tag methods to control the video. For
example:

&lt;video id="video0" x="0" y="0" width="1280" height="720"
xlink:href="http://youtube.com/myvideo.mp4"&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

**Code Sample**

The following simple code example shows the <span
class="Code">&lt;video&gt;</span> tag in action.

&lt;body&gt;

&lt;div id="DivParent"&gt;

**** **&lt;video class="Video" id="video1" src="http://video.mp4"
autoplay&gt;&lt;/video&gt;**

&lt;div id="DivSibling"&gt; The layer floating above the video
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;

Here <span class="Code">DivParent</span> is the parent of the video
object, and <span class="Code">DivSibling</span> is the sibling of the
video object and is displayed above it.

**&lt;audio&gt; Tag**

The <span class="Code">&lt;audio&gt;</span> tag is used to control audio
content within HTML applications. The <span
class="Code">&lt;audio&gt;</span> tag is a standard element supported by
HTML5; refer to [<span
class="URL">*http://www.w3.org*</span>](http://www.w3.org/){.body1} for
full a description.

In OpenTV 5, the behavior of the &lt;audio&gt; is relatively
straightforward, as in the following example:

&lt;audio controls&gt;

<span class="CodeBold">**&lt;source src="horse.ogg"
type="audio/ogg"&gt;**</span>

<span class="CodeBold">**&lt;source src="horse.mp3"
type="audio/mpeg"&gt;**</span>

Your browser does not support the audio tag.

&lt;/audio&gt;

The specific type of audio file supported will vary from platform to
platform, however it is expected that MP3 files will be used as a
default.

Application Installation
-----

This section describes how to install OpenTV5 applications.

**Overview**

OpenTV 5 uses W3C widget packages for application installation; the
package must be correctly structured and include a certificate/signature
in order to be valid.

**Installation Format**

**Installation Package**

Applications must be installed as a valid W3C widget package, conforming
to the following specifications: [<span
class="URL">*http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-widgets-20121127*</span>](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-widgets-20121127){.body1}.

A valid OpenTV package consists of a valid W3C widget package
containing:

• The configuration document, called <span
class="Variable">*OTVAppMetadata.xml*</span>.

• The application source files and assets, located at the root of the
widget package or subfolders.

• A start file, as referenced by <span
class="Variable">*OTVAppMetadata.xml*</span>

• Zero or more digital signatures located at the root of the widget
package.

**Certificates**

A certificate uses a digital signature to bind together a public key
with an identity. All application installations require certificates.

The OpenTV package uses XML digital signature, as specified at: [<span
class="URL">*http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-widgets-digsig-20130418*</span>](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-widgets-digsig-20130418){.body1}.

The signature syntax and processing specification is available at:
[<span
class="URL">*http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-xmldsig-core1-20130411*</span>](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-xmldsig-core1-20130411){.body1}.

A digital signature consists of:

• One Author signature file (<span
class="Variable">*author-signature.xml*</span>)

• One or more distributor signature files (<span
class="Variable">*signature1.xml*</span>)

To generate a digital signature, refer to: [<span
class="URL">*http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-widgets-digsig-20130418/\#algorithm-to-generate-a-digital-signature*</span>](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-widgets-digsig-20130418/#algorithm-to-generate-a-digital-signature){.body1}

To validate the digital signature, refer to: [<span
class="URL">*http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-widgets-digsig-20130418/\#algorithm-to-validate-digital-signatures*</span>](http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-widgets-digsig-20130418/#algorithm-to-validate-digital-signatures){.body1}

To generate the digital signature use following algorithms:

• For the SignedInfo Canonicalization Method Algorithm, refer to:\
[<span
class="URL">*http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n\#*</span>](http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n){.bullet1}

• For the SignedInfo Signature Method Algorithm, refer to:\
[<span
class="URL">*http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more\#rsa-sha256*</span>](http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256){.bullet1}

• For the Reference Digest Method Algorithm, refer to:\
[<span
class="URL">*http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc\#sha256*</span>](http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256){.bullet1}

• For the Property Transform Algorithm, refer to:\
[<span
class="URL">*http://www.w3.org/2006/12/xml-c14n11*</span>](http://www.w3.org/2006/12/xml-c14n11){.bullet1}

**Signature Format**

<span class="SmallCaps">**Note:**</span> A signed package contains
digital signature files; an unsigned package does not contain digital
signature files. All developers must provide signed packages, otherwise
installation fails.

The signature file (for the author or distributor) must use the
following:

• Canonicalization Method Algorithm for <span class="Code">SignedInfo\
</span>Used for normalization (to remove spaces, new lines) of the
content.

• Signature Method Algorithm for <span class="Code">SignedInfo\
</span>Used for calculating the signature value which is kept in the
“SignatureValue” element.

• The list of non-signature file name (URI) associated with digest
method algorithm and digest value, also called hash value, calculated
over the file. The digest method algorithm is used to calculate the
digest value.

• The property reference is the same as the non-signature file reference
above, but the digest value is calculated over the property element in
the XML file (<span class="Code">&lt;Object Id="prop”&gt; …
&lt;/Object&gt;</span>).

• A <span class="Code">SignatureValue</span> generated by the algorithm
associated with the SignatureMethod Algorithm.

• A list of one or more certificate in <span
class="Code">&lt;X509Certificate&gt;</span>.\
One of the certificates is an end entity certificate and the others are
CA certificates. The CA certificates are used for verification of end
entity certificate. The end entity certificate contains a valid public
key.

• A <span class="Code">Property</span> object element.\
This specifies the signature document properties and the user-defined
properties.

<span class="SmallCaps">**Note:**</span> in real deployment, networks or
network authorized entities will sign the application package. For
development purposes, Nagra provides a tool to package up and sign the
application.

**Downloading and Installing the Package**

After a valid installation package has been created for an application,
it must be installed onto the set-top box. This is accomplished using
Application Information Manager object (AIM) methods and events.

• Install using <span class="Code">installApp()\
</span>Requires a <span class="Code">downloadURL</span> string, which is
either a download server link, or a local zip file. This method checks
the client's credentials, downloads/copies the application package, adds
the application metadata to the application database, and sets the home
directory and permissions. If successful, it returns the new and unique
application UUID (identifying the application on the network) to the
caller via the <span class="Code">installAppOK</span> event.

• Installation Failed\
If the installation fails, an <span class="Code">installAppFailed</span>
event is generated. Failure to install is generally due to an invalid
installation package.

• Uninstall\
If an application is uninstalled after being successfully installed via
<span class="Code">uninstallApp()</span>, the system automatically
cleans up the application remnants, removing directories and data used
and accessed by the application. It also removes any configuration
settings defined by the application using the Configuration Manager
object methods.

• Configuration Manager\
Create entries for this application using the Configuration Manager.
Refer to [<span class="LiteralText">*Configuration Manager
Permissions*</span>](http://otv5docs/CCOM5.1.4/Support/Application%20Developer's%20Guide.htm#Racbabbedai){.Topic}
for details.

**Sample Installation Package**

A (valid) sample installation zip file can be found in the SDK tutorials
folder, one for each of the sample applications. In addition, NAGRA
provides a tool, the Application Controller, which can be used to
automatically create and sign a new installation package from a valid
collection of files.

**Permissions and the Application Metadata File**

When an application is installed, its application metadata file is
immediately read and processed, and its permissions automatically
validated by the Application Information Manager (AIM). Later, when a
running application attempts to use a component’s methods, its
permissions are checked by the component.

Overview of OpenTV5 API (CCOM)
-----

CCOM is the JavaScript API provided by Nagra to access the features of
OpenTV5 middleware.

This section describes the various CCOM objects and their functionality.
This is a broad and general view of the objects and their role in
application development; for a more detailed picture, refer to each
object’s specific tutorial and API documentation.

Starting with OpenTV5.1.3, the Middleware enforces a permissions scheme
restricting the features and resources an application is able to access.
This is detailed in the [<span
class="LiteralText">*Permissions*</span>](http://otv5docs/CCOM5.1.4/Support/Application%20Developer's%20Guide.htm#Racbabbjdih){.Topic}
section.

**Object Roles**

The following table gives a snapshot of CCOM objects and their roles.

**Object**

**Role**

**Canonical Methods**

Application

Facilitates communication between the application and the application
manager; generates events when an application takes an action or
messages are transmitted to an application. If an application wants to
defer going to low power mode (e.g. the user gets a "Do you want to go
to low power mode?" message) the application calls the delayLowPower
method.

•<span class="Code"> CCOM.Application.delayLowPower\
</span>Delays the system from going into low power mode.

AIM (AppInfoManager)

Stores and updates application metadata including signatures and client
permissions. Allows an application to run an SQL query to get an
application’s metadata. Also allows an application to be installed or
uninstalled.

• <span class="Code">CCOM.AppinfoManager.\
</span><span class="Code">getAppinfoByQuery\
</span>Creates a SQL query which returns a given application’s metadata.

ApplicationManager

Control applications: create, get status of, communicate with, suspend,
and destroy them.

•<span class="Code"> CCOM.ApplicationManager.launchApplication\
</span>Create a new application and supply it with all necessary initial
state data.

•<span class="Code"> CCOM.ApplicationManager.sendMessage\
</span>Send a message to a specified application.

AppTimeSource

Sets the system time.

•<span class="Code"> CCOM.AppTimeSource.setTimeData\
</span>Sets the time obtained from a remote server.

ConditionalAccess

Controls the set-top box smartcard (changing its settings, deleting
settings, altering permissions, checking PIN codes).

•<span class="Code"> CCOM.ConditionalAccess.changePinCode\
</span>Changes one of the PIN codes in the smartcard.

•<span class="Code"> CCOM.ConditionalAccess.validatePinCode\
</span>Challenge and check one of the smartcard PIN codes.

ConfigManager

Get and/or change configuration settings (as defined in directory paths
and in encryption keys, set key paths, etc.).

•<span class="Code"> CCOM.ConfigManager.setValue\
</span>Sets the value of the configuration key at a specific keypath.

•<span class="Code"> CCOM.ConfigManager.setEncryptedValue\
</span>Encrypts and sets the value of the configuration key at a
specific keypath.

ControlCenter

Allows for clearing of the Squid cache, as well as Factory reset or
Refurbishing.

•<span class="Code"> CCOM.ControlCenter.HttpCache.clear\
</span>Clears the Squid cache of stored objects.

DRM

Retrieves digital rights management information.

How to invoke CCOM APIs
------

The main CCOM object contains properties which are also objects, each
providing access to a sub-set of middleware functionality.

For example, the <span class="Code">CCOM.EPG</span> object provides EPG
functionality, while the <span class="Code">CCOM.SINetwork</span>
provides channel scan functionality.

To access OTV 5 middleware functionality, application developers must
use a JavaScript interface and a JavaScript binding layer to communicate
with CCOM objects. CCOM uses the Netscape Plug-in Application
Programming Interface (NPAPI) framework and must be loaded by the
application through the corresponding HTML tag: <span
class="Code">&lt;embed&gt;</span>.

Refer to the W3C web site ([<span
class="URL">*http://www.w3.org*</span>](http://www.w3.org/){.body1})for
further details.

In order to use a CCOM object, an application must first use the
JavaScript method <span class="Code">document.getElementById()</span> to
access the main, or root, CCOM object.

The following section summarizes how the <span
class="Code">getElementById()</span> method is used to access the main
CCOM object in OpenTV 5.

**Example:**

The following example illustrates how the method
document.getElementById<span class="Code">()</span> is used to access
the CCOM Configuration Manager object.

&lt;embed id="CCOMid" type="application/CCOM\_HTML" width="0"
height="0"&gt; &lt;/embed&gt;

&lt;script&gt;

    <span class="CodeBold">**v**</span><span class="CodeBold">**ar CCOM
= document.getElementById("CCOMid");**</span>

    <span class="CodeBold">**v**</span><span class="CodeBold">**ar
configMan = CCOM.ConfigManager;**</span>

&lt;/script&gt;

Application Permissions
------

This section describes the OpenTV5 application permission system.

**Overview**

Starting with OpenTV 5.1.3, a permissions-based application security
mechanism has been put into place, guaranteeing that applications can
only access authorized system operations, features, or resources.

Permissions are defined as authorizations (rights or privileges) granted
to an application, allowing access to specific system resources in
specific ways.

There are two general categories of permissions: those authorizing the
use of CCOM-based services (service permissions), and those authorizing
the use of system resources (resource permissions).

Service permissions allow access to various CCOM services, such as
methods or inter-object communication, while resource permissions allow
access to non-CCOM resources such as storage space, memory resources, or
devices (camera, keyboard, sensor).

An application accesses a CCOM service by connecting to the component
providing the service and invoking methods provided by the component;
service permissions are automatically enforced by the component
providing the service.

An application accesses non-CCOM resources (such as a networking
facility, dynamic memory, local file storage, external media, etc.) via
system capabilities depending on the resource; resource permissions are
configured when the application is launched.

In neither case is a developer required to do additional coding in order
to “enforce” permissions (after the permissions are initially defined).

The application’s metadata file contains all the service and resource
permissions authorized for the application, which are explained in
detail in the following.

**Permissions and the Application Metadata File**

When an application is installed, its application metadata file is
immediately read and processed, and its permissions automatically
validated by the Application Information Manager (AIM). Later, when a
running application attempts to use a component’s methods, its
permissions are checked by the component.

 

**Service Permissions**

Service permissions are separated into two major categories:

• Permission based on a CCOM API:\
Each permission authorizes the use of a specific API of the component.

• Permission based on groups of related CCOM APIs:\
Each permission authorizes the use of a specific group of APIs; or, they
may be based on the features that the component implements via its APIs,
where each permission enables or constrains the use of the component's
APIs in a specific manner.

Each CCOM service is identified by a globally unique service name, and
each service permission is identified by a unique service permission
string within the component providing the service.

These service names and service permission strings, in combination,
identify the services and operations authorized for the application in
the application metadata file.

Service permissions are explicitly defined in the application's metadata
file, as in this example:

&lt;otv:AUTHORIZATIONS&gt;

    &lt;otv:SERVICES&gt;

        &lt;otv:AppinfoManager&gt;

            &lt;otv:PERMISSIONS&gt;MANAGE&lt;/otv:PERMISSIONS&gt;

        &lt;/otv:AppinfoManager&gt;

        &lt;otv:ApplicationManager&gt;

            &lt;otv:PERMISSIONS&gt;QUERY&lt;/otv:PERMISSIONS&gt;

        &lt;/otv:ApplicationManager&gt;

            \[... other CCOM Objects...\]

    &lt;/otv:SERVICES&gt;

&lt;/otv:AUTHORIZATIONS&gt;

 

\[...material following deleted...\]

The general format of service permissions is:

&lt;otv:AUTHORIZATIONS&gt;

&lt;otv:SERVICES&gt;

    <span class="CodeBold">**&lt;**</span><span
class="CodeBold">**otv:CCOM\_Object\_Name&gt;**</span>

        &lt;otv:PERMISSIONS&gt; {one or more Permission\_Strings}

        &lt;/otv:PERMISSIONS&gt;

    <span class="CodeBold">**&lt;**</span><span
class="CodeBold">**/otv:CCOM\_Object\_Name&gt;**</span>

&lt;/otv:SERVICES&gt;

&lt;/otv:AUTHORIZATIONS&gt;

Where <span class="Code">CCOM\_Object\_Name</span> is the name of the
CCOM object having permissions defined, one of the following:

AppinfoManager

Application

ApplicationManager

ConditionalAccess

ConfigManager

ControlCenter

DRM

EPG

HomeNetworking

IpNetwork

MediaLibrary

PlayerManager

WindowManager

Refer to the following section for valid permission strings.

**CCOM Permission Strings**

CCOM service permissions are specified for each object. An application
can have full, partial, or multiple CCOM object service permissions.

These permissions are listed in the API documentation for each method.

<span class="SmallCaps">**Note:**</span> if an object method is not
listed as needing a specific permission, it does not require a
permission in order to be accessed. For example, <span
class="Code">getConnectionInfo() </span>(part of the SINetwork CCOM
object), requires no permission to use.\
\
The only exception is deprecated methods; all deprecated methods require
ADMIN permission, even if not explicitly stated elsewhere.

<span class="SmallCaps">**Additional Note**</span>: the global methods
<span class="Code">addEventListener()</span> and <span
class="Code">removeEventListener()</span>, available to all CCOM
objects, do not require permissions in order to be used.

The following table lists the valid permission strings. Note that not
all permission strings are valid/useful for all CCOM Objects.

+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+

An outline of the various configuration setting locations and their
interactions follows:

**Path or File**

**Description**

**Notes**

\[application installation folder\]/OTVAppMetadata.xml

The path and name of the application configuration file for the
application having permissions defined.

This file contains all the permissions defined for the application, and
references one or more network access profiles used by the configuration
manager, and might further restrict the permission paths defined by
them.

/system/opentv/configman/profiles

Location of access profiles on the network, used to define configuration
manager permissions.

Defines the default paths accessible by PROFILE\_1 to PROFILE\_8\
\
Paths defined in these files should include paths required by
applications referencing them; applications cannot define paths not
already contained within one or more of these files.

/system/opentv/otvsec/memory-resource-mapping

Defines the maximum memory values

String values are either SMALL, MEDIUM, or LARGE, and referenced by the
application configuration file. The actual memory size values are
defined by integer at the network configuration location.

<span class="Code">/applications/</span><span
class="Code">AUTHOR\_</span><span class="Code">Name/App\_</span><span
class="Code">ID</span>

Defines the network location for the application’s specific folder.

Heavy restrictions exist for the characters allowed in these path
components; refer to the [<span class="zlink">Application-specific
Directory
Structure</span>](http://otv5docs/CCOM5.1.4/Support/Application%20Developer's%20Guide.htm#Racbabgfibc){.Link}
for details. Must match values defined in the application configuration
file.

[]()**Configuration Manager Permissions**

The Configuration Manager object does not operate like other objects.

Instead of defining permissions for how Configuration Manager interacts
with other objects, this set of permissions defines how Configuration
Manager interacts with and reads/modifies the configuration tree.

Permissions are not defined on a method-by-method basis. Permissions
apply to all methods in the Configuration Manager object equally and
uniformly.

There are nine permission strings used with this object:

•<span class="Code"> ENCRYPT\
</span>Allows an application access to selected encrypted parts of the
configuration tree.

•<span class="Code"> PROFILE\_1, PROFILE\_2, PROFILE\_3, PROFILE\_4,
PROFILE\_5, PROFILE6, PROFILE\_7, PROFILE\_8\
</span>Eight profiles that control the amount of access the application
has to the configuration tree. These profiles are defined on a
network-by-network basis.

[]()**Application-specific Directory Structure**

Application-specific configuration settings are stored in specific
directories within the <span class="Code">/applications</span> subtree,
subject to the following restrictions:

• An application producer has a producer-specific configuration
directory under <span class="Code">/applications</span>, the name of
which matches the value of the <span class="Code">AUTHOR</span> element
in the application metadata file. For example, a producer with the <span
class="Code">AUTHOR</span> value of jimmy-X must have a
producer-specific directory at <span
class="Code">/applications/jimmy-X</span>.

• Each application from the same producer has an application-specific
configuration directory under the producer-specific configuration
directory of its producer, the name of which matches the value of the
<span class="Code">APP\_ID</span> element in the application metadata
file. For example, an application with <span class="Code">APP\_ID</span>
values of application-Y and application-Z, both from producer jimmy-X,
each must have an application-specific configuration directory at <span
class="Code">/applications/jimmy-X/application-Y</span> and <span
class="Code">/applications/jimmy-X/application-Z</span>, respectively.

• Naming restrictions:\
The <span class="Code">AUTHOR</span> and <span
class="Code">APP\_ID</span> values must not contain any of the following
characters: <span class="Code">\\/ \\\\ \\t \\r \\n ” \$ & &lt; &gt; , +
= \# ! ( ) ‘ | \[ \] ? \~ \` ; \*</span>. Due to these naming
restrictions, Configuration Manager replaces any non-conforming
characters from the <span class="Code">AUTHOR</span> or <span
class="Code">APP\_ID</span> values from the application metadata with an
underscore ('\_') when forming the producer- or application-specific
directory name.

• In a sandboxed runtime environment, an application accesses a
configuration setting within its application-specific directory by using
a relative path from the root of its application-specific directory. For
example, if application-Y from producer-X needs to access a setting
named my-key-Y in the subdirectory my-subdir-Y within its
application-specific directory, it would use the relative keypath of
<span class="Code">my-subdir-Y/my-key-Y</span> (or, optionally, .<span
class="Code">/my-subdir-Y/my-key-Y</span>), which would access the
setting found at the absolute path <span
class="Code">/applications/producer-X/application-Y/my-subdir-Y/my-key-Y</span>.

• In a non-sandboxed runtime environment, an application accesses a
configuration setting within its application-specific directory by using
an absolute path from the root of the configuration tree, e.g.: <span
class="Code">/applications/producer-X/application-Y/my-key-Y</span>.

• In a sandboxed runtime environment, an application accesses a
configuration setting within its producer-specific directory by using a
relative path of .. (two consecutive dots) that refers to its
producer-specific directory. For example, if application-Y from
producer-X needs to access a setting named my-producer-key-Y in its
producer-specific directory, it would use the relative path of<span
class="Code"> ../my-producer-key-Y</span>, which would access the
setting found at the absolute path <span
class="Code">/applications/producer-X/my-producer-key-Y</span>.

• In a non-sandboxed runtime environment, an application accesses a
configuration setting within its producer-specific directory by using an
absolute path from the root of the configuration tree, e.g.:<span
class="Code"> /applications/producer-X/my-producer-key-Y</span>.

To ensure an application runs properly in either a sandboxed or
non-sandboxed runtime environment, applications should be written to
access configuration settings using absolute path names only.

New applications should be designed to use application-specific and
producer-specific directories for settings.

Be aware that an application-specification configuration directory of an
application is removed when the application is uninstalled.

Note: For more details about how the configuration tree is structured,
refer to the <span class="Title">*Configuration Guide*</span>.

[]()**Access Profiles**

Application access to configuration settings is limited by default as
follows:

•<span class="Code"> read-write</span> access to settings in its own
application-specific configuration directory, and

•<span class="Code"> read-only</span> access to settings in its
producer-specific configuration directory.

To access a configuration setting elsewhere in the configuration tree,
even the application-specific directory of another application from the
same producer, the application <span class="Variable">*must have
explicit permission*</span> to access the directory containing the
setting.

This permission is specified by an access profile in the application’s
metadata file, as well as the allowable paths defined in <span
class="Code">/system/opentv/configman/profiles.</span>

Eight possible access profiles, <span class="Code">PROFILE\_1</span> to
<span class="Code">PROFILE\_8</span>, control this access. An access
profile consists of a list of one or more access permissions, including
an access mode (read-only, read-write, or no-access), and a
configuration pathname for the configuration subtree covered by the
profile.

An application with a particular access profile is allowed to access
configuration settings via the absolute pathname in the profile and the
specified access mode in the profile, in addition to the configuration
settings in its application-specific directory and producer-specific
directory. The access profile definitions are stored as string lists
named <span class="Code">profile-1</span> to <span
class="Code">profile-8</span> in the <span
class="Code">/system/opentv/configman/profiles</span> configuration
subtree.

At present, there are placeholders (empty lists) for <span
class="Code">profile-1</span> to <span class="Code">profile-7</span>
under <span class="Code">/system/opentv/configman/profiles</span>. There
is a defined <span class="Code">profile-8</span> in the Configuration
Manager default xml file as well; this profile, defined to permit
read-write access to the entire configuration tree, is currently
required by various built-in EPG applications (e.g., Gravity, etc.),
which need to access configuration settings throughout the configuration
tree. The metadata for these applications has been modified to include
<span class="Code">PROFILE\_8</span> permission. Without this profile,
these applications fail at launch.

A system default profile can be found at <span
class="Code">/system/opentv/configman/profiles/system</span>. This
profile defines read-only access to the <span
class="Code">/system/opentv/rtes</span> and <span
class="Code">/system/opentv/services</span> subtrees, which is needed to
run any application.

An additional network default profile is defined at <span
class="Code">/system/opentv/configman/profiles/network</span>, although
as currently defined it is an empty list, and it may be used to define a
network-specific profile that is needed to run any application.

**Changing the Profile Definitions**

Default profile paths are defined in <span
class="Code">/system/opentv/configman/profiles.</span>

Three definitions are allowed when defining profiles:

•<span class="Code"> readwrite\
</span>Allows for read-write access to the associated directory and any
directory below it.

•<span class="Code"> readonly\
</span>Allows read-only access to the associated directory and any
directory below it.

•<span class="Code"> noaccess\
</span>Neither read nor write access is granted to the associated
directory nor any directory below it.

For example, suppose <span class="Code">PROFILE\_1</span> is needed to
allow an application to access the settings in the following subtrees:

• read-write access to <span class="Code">/users/preferences</span>

• read-only access to <span class="Code">/applications/common</span>

• read-only access to <span class="Code">/users/default</span>

The access profile is defined as a string list in the metadata file with
the access permissions:

•<span class="Code"> readwrite:/users/preferences</span>

•<span class="Code"> readonly:/applications/common</span>

•<span class="Code"> readonly:/users/default</span>

If an application has <span class="Code">PROFILE\_1</span> specified in
its metadata file, the application is allowed to read or write settings
in or below <span class="Code">/users/preferences</span> and read
settings in or below <span class="Code">/applications/common</span> and
<span class="Code">/users/default</span>.

If <span class="Code">PROFILE\_2</span> is required to allow an
application from producer-X to read or write the settings of
application-Y, also from the same producer, i.e., to read or write
settings in or below <span
class="Code">/applications/&lt;producer-X&gt;/&lt;application-Y&gt;</span>,
the access profile is defined as a string list at <span
class="Code">/system/opentv/configman/profiles/profile-2</span>
containing the access permission:

readwrite:../&lt;application-Y&gt;

Then, if an application from producer-X, say application-Z, has the
<span class="Code">profile\_2</span> permission specified in its
metadata file, the application is allowed to read or write settings in
or below <span
class="Code">/applications/&lt;producer-X&gt;/&lt;application-Y&gt;</span>.

Any application from producer-X with the <span
class="Code">PROFILE\_3</span> permission specified in its metadata is
allowed to read the settings of any other application from producer-X.
Since an application is always allowed to read or write its own settings
and to read the settings of its producer, the access permissions <span
class="Code">readwrite:.</span> and <span
class="Code">readonly:..</span> are implied and don’t need to be
explicitly specified.

To prevent access to part of a subtree even though other parts of the
subtree are accessible, <span class="Code">noaccess</span> is used. For
example, suppose that <span class="Code">PROFILE\_4</span> should allow
read-only access to the <span class="Code">/users/preferences
</span>subtree but not allow access (neither read-only nor read-write)
to the <span class="Code">/users/preferences/parental-rating</span>
setting. In this case, the access profile <span
class="Code">/system/opentv/configman/profiles/profile-4</span> is
defined as a string list containing the access permissions:

•<span class="Code"> readonly:/users/preferences</span>

•<span class="Code"> noaccess:/users/preferences/parental-rating</span>

An application may specify more than one access profile in its metadata.
In general, the order of the profiles specified in the application's
metadata is not significant, nor is the order of access permissions
within an access profile. However, if the same configuration pathname is
specified more than once for the same application (because the pathname
appears in more than one profile specified by the application or because
the pathname appears more than once in the same profile), then the last
sequential appearance of the pathname and the associated access mode
replaces any previous appearance of the pathname and associated access
mode.

**Sample Profile Definition**

Partial file example, located in <span
class="Code">/system/opentv/configman/profiles</span>.

&lt;dir name="configman"&gt;

    &lt;dir name="profiles"&gt;

    &lt;!-- profiles that are specified in app metadata --&gt;

    ...

    &lt;entry name="profile-3" type="list" ltype="string"&gt;

    &lt;/entry&gt;

    &lt;entry name="profile-4" type="list" ltype="string"&gt;

    &lt;/entry&gt;

    &lt;entry name="profile-5" type="list" ltype="string"&gt;

    &lt;/entry&gt;

    &lt;entry name="profile-6" type="list" ltype="string"&gt;

    &lt;/entry&gt;

    &lt;entry name="profile-7" type="list" ltype="string"&gt;

    &lt;/entry&gt;

    &lt;entry name="profile-8" type="list" ltype="string"&gt;

    &lt;!-- profile for builtin EPG apps --&gt;

        &lt;li type="string"&gt;

        &lt;stringvalue&gt;readwrite:/&lt;/stringvalue&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/entry&gt;

    &lt;/dir&gt;

&lt;/dir&gt;

[]()**Encrypt**

Application access to encrypted configuration settings is allowed only
if the application’s metadata file specifies the ENCRYPT permission. In
the absence of an access profile in the application’s metadata, an
application with ENCRYPT permission is allowed read-write access to
encrypted settings in its application-specific directory and read-only
access to encrypted settings in its producer-specific directory.

If an application with ENCRYPT permission also has one or more access
profile permissions, the application is allowed to access encrypted
settings in the subtrees specified by the corresponding access
profile(s) as constrained by the corresponding access mode.

**Resource Permissions**

Resource permissions are defined in the application metadata file, with
some definitions for memory maximums also found at <span
class="Code">/system/opentv/otvsec/memory-resource-mapping.</span>

The following system resources are currently supported:

• Network access:\
The <span class="Code">&lt;otv:NETWORK&gt;</span> resource permission
element allows the application to use network interfaces.

• RAM usage:\
The <span class="Code">&lt;otv:MEMORY&gt;</span> resource permission
element specifies how much RAM the application is allowed to use. The
text content of the element is either <span class="Code">SMALL</span>,
<span class="Code">MEDIUM</span>, or <span class="Code">LARGE</span>.
The corresponding memory size values are defined by integer
configuration settings under <span
class="Code">/system/opentv/otvsec/memory-resource-mapping</span> in the
default configuration tree.

• Local storage:\
The <span class="Code">&lt;otv:STORAGE&gt;</span> resource permission
element allows the application to use local persistent storage.
Currently, only the presence of this permission is required to allow
local storage usage, without constraint on how much is used. Presence of
string values SMALL, MEDIUM, or LARGE has no effect.

• Key stealing:\
The <span class="Code">&lt;otv:KEYS&gt;</span> resource permission
element defined the list of keys that the application is allowed to
steal when it is not in-focus. The text content of the element is a list
of logical key names may include any of the following: <span
class="Code">DOM\_VK\_ENTER, DOM\_VK\_DELETE, DOM\_VK\_LEFT,
DOM\_VK\_RIGHT, DOM\_VK\_UP, DOM\_VK\_DOWN, DOM\_VK\_PAGE\_UP,
DOM\_VK\_PAGE\_DOWN, OTV\_RED, OTV\_BLUE, OTV\_YELLOW, OTV\_GREEN,
OTV\_0, OTV\_1, OTV\_2, OTV\_3, OTV\_4, OTV\_5, OTV\_6, OTV\_7, OTV\_8,
OTV\_9, OTV\_F6,</span> and <span class="Code">OTV\_F7</span>.

An example from an application configuration file follows, in which
network access is permitted, local storage is permitted, four keys are
active, and the memory permission is MEDIUM:

...

&lt;otv:RESOURCES&gt;

    &lt;otv:NETWORK/&gt;

    &lt;otv:STORAGE&gt;SMALL&lt;/otv:STORAGE&gt;

    &lt;otv:KEYS&gt;OTV\_YELLOW OTV\_BLUE OTV\_F6
OTV\_F7&lt;/otv:KEYS&gt;

    &lt;otv:MEMORY&gt;MEDIUM&lt;/otv:MEMORY&gt;

&lt;/otv:RESOURCES&gt;

...

**Sample Permission-enabled Application Metadata File**

permissions, as well as the following resource permissions: network,
memory, local storage, and four keys.

Digital Storage Media Command and Control (DSMCC)
------

**Overview**

This section describes how an application can register for and receive
digital storage media command and control (DSMCC) stream event
information.

OpenTV 5.1.4 will run HTML5 applications configured as <span
class="Code">AUTOSTART</span> by an application information table (AIT)
and transported by a DSMCC object carousel, where both the carousel and
the AIT are available in the currently-tuned transport stream. It is
expected that the carousel has been mounted to the OpenTV5 middleware
and that the application’s constituent files are accessible as though
they were local. This capability is wanted particularly by networks
without IP accessibility.

Such an application may also listen for and respond to DSMCC stream
events, so, for example, the applications can know when to change the UI
it’s presenting.

Also, applications may want to use files that reside in a DSMCC object
carousel different from the carousel they were acquired from.

**Requesting Individual Objects from a Carousel**

A file in a mounted DSMCC object carousel may be referenced by an HTML5
web page acquired from the same carousel by referring to the file using
its relative path. For example, a CSS file or an image file may be
referred to by a pathname relative to the directory from which the start
page is acquired. No file handling CCOM API is needed in this case,
since the browser is running the application directly from an object
carousel that has been mounted. Hence, the file appears as though it
were local. The application and its files are isolated adequately
because the same container rules are applied to the mounted carousel.

The following describes the API to use for acquiring a text or XML file
from a carousel.

**Requesting Individual Objects from a Carousel**

In order to have access to the content of a carousel file, the <span
class="Code">XMLHttpRequest</span> object can be used with the following
constraints:

• Parameters passed to the <span class="Code">open()</span> method

• **method**: Set to “GET”

• **url**: Can be relative to the location of the current page in the
carousel’s file system, or an absolute dvb:URL

• **async**: Set to true

• **user**: Ignore

• **password**: Ignore

• *status* is a property that becomes visible on the same <span
class="Code">XMLHttpRequest</span> object once a response has been
received from the server

The caller must first register a listener for *readyStateChange* events
on the <span class="Code">XMLHttpRequest</span> object, then call the
method <span class="Code">send()</span> to send the request to the
server. The *readyState* property is set to <span
class="Code">DONE</span> <span class="Code">(4)</span> once a response
has been received. It is only at that time that *status* and
*statusText* can be read (you can set the *onreadyStateChange* property
directly on the <span class="Code">XMLHttpRequest</span> object to
attach an event listener on that object).

It is also at that point that the *responseText* and *responseXML*
properties are valid.

*status* is set to 200 when the DSMCC object is found and to 404 when it
is not present in the carousel or the corresponding carousel has been
unmounted.

• *statusText* is a property that becomes visible on the same
`XMLHttpRequest` object once a response has been received from the
server. It is set to `OK` if status is `200` or `Not Found` if the
status is `404`.

• Headers are not relevant for carousel access:

• Calls to `setRequestHeader()` are ignored

• `getResponseHeader()` returns null and `getAllResponseHeaders()`
returns an empty string

• Values of the *responseText* and *responseXML* properties are shown in
the table below:

  DSMCC object   URL example                  responseText                                                                                                                                                     responseXML
  -------------- ---------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  File           `/weather/data.xml`          Returns the "text response entity body" as defined in `XMLHTTPRequest`.                                                                                          If the file has the extension .xml, returns the "XML response entity body" as defined in `XMLHTTPRequest`. Otherwise, returns null.
  Directory      `/weather`                   Comma-separated list of names (filename, stream event name, or directory name) of all objects in the directory. These names will not include path information.   null
  Stream event   `/weather/main/streamEvt1`   Comma-separated list of names of all events in the stream-event object                                                                                           null

Examples of dvb:URLs that may be used with the XMLHttpRequest object
are:

• `/weather/data.xml` (absolute path from the root of the carousel of
the current page)

• `../weather/data.xml` (relative path to the current page)

• `dvb://1..1.B8/weather/data.xml` (`0xB8` is the component tag)

**Usage Model for Subscribing to a Stream Event**

Add a listener for a specified DSMCC stream event.

When a broadcaster transmits an identical instance of an MPEG
private-data section carrying a stream-event descriptor (including the
version number), only one *StreamEvent* event is dispatched.

When a broadcaster transmits different events using the same event name
ID (i.e. with different version numbers), one *StreamEvent* event is
dispatched for each different stream-event descriptor received.

Listeners are automatically unregistered on successful channel change.

&lt;script&gt;\

ListenerForObjFile = function(e)\
    {\
    //check for events that are for my object\
    if(e.event == “eventA”)\
        }\
        // call some handler for event A\
        }\
    else if(e.event == “eventB”)\
        }\
        // call some handler for event B\
        }\
    else if(e.event == “eventC”)\
        }\
        // call some handler for event C\
        }\
    else if(e.event == “eventD”)\
        }\
        // call some handler for event D\
        }\
    }\
\
CCOM.Dsmcc.addEventListener(onStreamEventReceived, ListenerForObjFile)\
\
CCOM.Dsmcc.subscribeToStreamEvent("dvb://1.2.3.B8/strmfile1", "eventA")\
CCOM.Dsmcc.subscribeToStreamEvent("dvb://1.2.3.B8/strmfile1", "eventB")\
CCOM.Dsmcc.subscribeToStreamEvent("dvb://1.2.3.B8/strmfile2", "eventC")\
CCOM.Dsmcc.subscribeToStreamEvent("dvb://1.2.3.B8/strmfile2", "eventD")\
\
&lt;/script&gt;

**Unsubscribe from a Stream Event**

When a listener for a specified DSMCC stream event is no longer wanted,
you can unsubscribe from notice of that stream event:

CCOM.Dsmcc.unsubscribeFromStreamEvent(&lt;stream-event-obj-file1&gt;,
"eventA")

The `<stream-event-obj-file1>` specifies the URL of the DSMCC
`StreamEvent` object. This may be, for example:

targetUri = "dvb://" + originalNetworkId + "." + transportStreamId +\
'.' + serviceId + "." + componentTag + "/dir1/dir2/strmfile1"

`eventA` specifies the name of the event whose subscription should be
removed.

Multiple Application Support
------

## Overview

As of 5.1.3, more than one application can be run concurrently, limited
only by resource availability (memory, CPU, etc.).

Application installation and control primarily use two CCOM objects: the
Application Information Manager (AIM), and the Application Manager
(AppMan).

## Application Information Manager

The Application Information Manager (AIM) object is responsible for
storing information about applications available on the system, as well
as applications capable of being downloaded in the future. This
information consists of the application name, metadata, and other
details.

Using AIM object methods, developers are able to download and install
applications, uninstall them, update them, and enforce credentials.
Applications are packaged as W3C widgets and installed using <span class="Code">installApp()</span>, which checks
certificates, permissions, and does other necessary bookkeeping before
installing the application.

## Application Manager

Once an application has been installed, the Application Manager (AppMan)
object methods can be used by developers to control applications by:

• Starting, Stopping, and Querying applications about their status, in
addition to launching an application, giving it focus (making it display
on top of any other application).

• Transmitting messages between applications.

• Creating notifications about application changes, such as application
launched, application destroyed, etc.

Key stealing is accomplished using the Windows Manager.

## Manipulating Applications

In general, Application Manager object methods are responsible for
controlling applications. These methods allow an application to:

• Launch an application.

• Destroy a running application.

• Query an application’s status, or list the currently running
applications.

• Send messages to another applications.

The Windows Manager object methods allows an application to “steal” keys
(receiving input from the keyboard via events), however there are
limitations to this:

• Key stealing is only allowed for keys defined in the <span
class="Code">&lt;resource&gt;</span> section of the application metadata
file. In this example, the OTV\_YELLOW OTV\_BLUE keys are defined, and
therefore may be captured:

&lt;otv:RESOURCES&gt;

    &lt;otv:NETWORK/&gt;

    &lt;otv:STORAGE&gt;SMALL&lt;/otv:STORAGE&gt;

    &lt;otv:KEYS&gt;OTV\_YELLOW OTV\_BLUE&lt;/otv:KEYS&gt;

    &lt;otv:MEMORY&gt;MEDIUM&lt;/otv:MEMORY&gt;

&lt;/otv:RESOURCES&gt;

• Keys are not automatically captured when the application starts; use
the Windows Manager <span class="Code">registerInputEvents()</span>
method and set the <span class="Variable">*winmanInputEventTypes*</span>
to define the capture keys.

The following MultiApp issues should also be kept in mind:

• Applications are, in general, “persistent,” meaning that applications
re-launch automatically should they stop unexpectedly (due to a reboot,
for example).

• The only way to transmit information between applications is via <span
class="Code">CCOM.ApplicationManager.sendMessage()</span>.

• Application resource usage and application permissions are defined by
the application metadata file and checked/implemented during
installation. Care should be taken not overload the system by running
too many applications, whose additive demands upon CPU and other
resources might cause slowdowns.

## Manipulate Multiple Applications, Step-by-Step

What follows is a rough outline of how to manipulate multiple
applications using Application Manager and Windows Manager methods.

1\. Let’s assume three applications, <span class="Code">App1</span>,
<span class="Code">App2</span>, and <span class="Code">Switcher</span>
have been successfully installed on the network via the Application
Information Manager’s <span class="Code">installApp()</span> method.
<span class="Code">Switcher</span> is a master application, already
launched, which sits in the background and controls the other two
applications.

2\. The two applications (<span class="Code">App1</span> and <span
class="Code">App2)</span>have been assigned global UUID numbers by <span
class="Code">appInstall()</span>, which uniquely distinguishes them.

3\. The <span class="Code">Switcher</span> application, already running,
launches these two applications using <span
class="Code">launchApplication()</span>, which requires the UUID values
of the two applications. Listen for the <span
class="Code">launchApplicationOK</span> event, and if two events are
generated (one for each application), both applications should be
running.

4\. To double-check they are running, call <span
class="Code">isApplicationRunning()</span> and listen for the <span
class="Code">isApplicationRunningOK</span> event. If two events are
returned, it serves as confirmation that <span class="Code">App1</span>
and <span class="Code">App2</span> are both running.

5\. When an application has focus, it captures all keys except those
stolen by other applications. In order to set an application to capture
keys, use the Windows Manager object and the <span
class="Code">registerInputEvents()</span> method, which allows any
application to “steal” keys from input events. As always, the only keys
an application is allowed to capture are those defined in its
application metadata file. <span class="Code">Switcher</span> has been
configured to steal keys from both <span class="Code">App1</span> and
<span class="Code">App2</span> when they are running.

6\. When <span class="Code">Switcher</span> steals a remote control key
press, indicating that the user wants <span class="Code">App1</span> to
close, Switcher uses <span
class="Code">CCOM.ApplicationManager.destroyApplication()</span> to
close <span class="Code">App1</span>. <span class="Code">Switcher</span>
again has focus since it is the only currently-running application.

7\. Should the user wish to run <span class="Code">App2</span>, he
presses the appropriate button. <span class="Code">Switcher</span>
receives the input and uses <span
class="Code">launchApplication()</span>to launch <span
class="Code">App2</span>, which when it starts will have focus over
<span class="Code">Switcher</span>.

In general, when multiple applications are run concurrently, one
application serves as the main “switcher,” determining which
applications will be shut down or started, and therefore which
application currently has focus.

Application Metadata File
-----

## Overview

The application metadata file (<span
class="Variable">*OTVAppMetadata.xml*</span>) is required in order to
install, configure, and define applications. It is part of an
application installation package, and when installed it is located in
the base application folder.

A typical example follows:

&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;

&lt;AIM&gt;

&lt;AUTHOR&gt;NAGRA&lt;/AUTHOR&gt;

&lt;NAME&gt;CCOMTutorial&lt;/NAME&gt;

Key Mapping
--------

This section summarizes SVG key mapping.

**Virtual and Physical Keys**

Virtual key values are listed as actual physical key values, which are
defined in DOM virtual key codes. The translated key values are then
translated to the Unicode equivalent. For example, the virtual key
values for ‘a’ and ‘A’ are the same and they are distinguished by the
modifier, which is the SHIFT or CAPS key in this example.

From a JavaScript application point of view, the KeyboardEvent object
has three event types: keydown, keypress, keyup. Each event has
attributes including keyCode, charCode, and which.

• The ‘which’ attribute is usually the same as ‘keyCode’.

• The ‘charCode’ attribute maps to the translated Unicode equivalent key
values.

• The ‘keyCode’ attribute maps to the physical keys (DOM\_VK\_\*) and
uses modifiers to distinguish keys like ‘+’ and ‘=’.

Certain remote control keys may be mapped differently depending on the
remote control or project. For example, the VOD, SEARCH, APP, and PIP
buttons are not listed in the table. In this case, use CUSTOM keys (i.e.
CUSTOM0, CUSTOM1, CUSTOM2,…) to define their mappings.

OpenTV recommends that the JavaScript application use ‘keyCode’ because
remote control keys are mapped to this.

SVG text elements use the translated key values if editable.

HTML forms use the virtual key values.

For more information about DOM KeyboardEvent, refer to [<span
class="URL">*https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/KeyboardEvent*</span>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/KeyboardEvent){.body1}.

**Spatial Navigation**

Spatial navigation using key codes is fully supported. When the remote
control is used to change focus on screen elements, the element with
focus generates a focus event.

Some remote controllers has a “Ok”, “Select”, or “Enter” button. Most of
them are mapped to use “OK”, keycode <span class="Code">0xF00B</span>.

Note that the “OK key” does not generate click event.
