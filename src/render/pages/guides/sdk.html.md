# OpenTV 5 SDK

## Overview

### Audience

This document is intended for developers using OpenTV5 to create HTML
applications. The reader is expected to be familiar with the JavaScript
programming language, HTML, CSS, and general object-oriented software
programming principles.

### Custom vs. Standards

This documentation covers:

* Unique features of OpenTV5, and
* Deviations from standard HTML/JavaScript norms.

For general, non-specific information about HTML/JavaScript usage, refer
to one of many web resources, such as [*http://www.w3schools.com/*](http://www.w3schools.com/), for tutorials and specifications.

The *OpenTV 5 HTML Advanced Developerâ€™s Guide* is also included in this
documentation set: refer to it for detailed advice about how to build
efficient applications using OpenTV WebKit, particularly techniques to
maximize performance on a hardware-limited embedded device such as a
set-top box.
